# Node.js-Project

"In deploying a web application on AWS, Load Balancing is critical for distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and enhancing reliability and scalability.

When deploying a Node.JS theme on AWS, setting up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Application Load Balancer (ALB) is typical. These automatically distribute traffic to multiple instances, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal performance.

Load Balancers play a key role in preventing bottlenecks and automatically routing traffic to healthy instances, improving overall reliability and availability.

In summary, Load Balancing is vital for maintaining high availability, scalability, and reliability of web applications on AWS. I developed this project to incorporate these principles and enhance performance."
